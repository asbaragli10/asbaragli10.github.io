I'm a manufacturing data scientist specializing in digital transformation for human-centric production systems. Currently serving as a [Knowledge Transfer Partnership Associate](https://iuk-ktp.org.uk/) at [Merit](https://www.merit.co.uk/) in collaboration with [Newcastle University School of Engineering](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/), I focus on bridging academic research and industrial applications in the construction manufacturing sector. My work centers on a fundamental question: How can we leverage cyber-physical systems and data-driven methodologies to enhance manufacturing efficiency, worker safety, and operational sustainability?

My research foundation was established during my doctoral studies at the [Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Trento](https://www.dii.unitn.it/), where I developed cyber-physical architectures for monitoring and optimizing manual task execution in industrial environments. This involved deploying diverse IoT sensor networks—including Ultra-WideBand RTLS, inertial measurement units, Azure Kinect systems, and electromyography devices—across more than 70 workers in both SME and multinational production settings. The resulting datasets enabled machine learning applications that addressed real-world challenges in production monitoring, worker safety assessment, and process optimization.

My approach combines technical implementation with business alignment. I've managed experimental campaigns involving 30+ stakeholders across organizational hierarchies, translating manufacturing operational requirements into technical specifications for digital solutions. This includes developing PowerApps-based MES systems, implementing ETL pipelines for real-time data streams, and designing analytics platforms using technologies such as React, Grafana, Dash, and Streamlit. My technical toolkit spans the modern data science stack—from MQTT and Node-Red for ingestion to PyTorch and TensorFlow for model development, deployed across cloud platforms including Azure Databricks, AWS, and GCP.
During my visiting research at the [Faculty of Engineering Technology at the University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/et/), I coordinated a large-scale experimental campaign involving 40+ participants across eight production configurations, generating over one million data points. This research explored how reconfigurable manufacturing systems can be monitored and optimized through cyber-physical architectures. The project demonstrated practical applications of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms in addressing efficiency and sustainability challenges in human-centric production environments.

My current work focuses on integrating Building Information Modeling with manufacturing execution systems in the construction industry. What principles can guide the convergence of design data and production processes? I explore this through the implementation of IoT networks, AI-driven analytics, and MRP systems that enable improved production monitoring and planning. My academic background—combining a PhD in Industrial Engineering, dual Master's degrees in [Management Engineering from the University of Bologna](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/EngineeringManagement), and an MBA from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) informs my approach to technology transfer and digital transformation initiatives.

Throughout my career, I've maintained a focus on the human dimension of manufacturing systems. The most effective digital architectures are those that enhance rather than replace human expertise, providing workers and decision-makers with timely, relevant information. Each ML model, dashboard, and cyber-physical system I develop serves a specific purpose: to transform distributed manufacturing data into actionable insights that drive operational improvements while prioritizing worker safety and process sustainability. This philosophy guides my work at the intersection of industrial engineering, data science, and organizational change management.
