# Work experience

- 2025–present: Digital Transformation Lead, Merit, Newcastle Upon Tyne  
  Position funded by Innovate UK as a Knowledge Transfer Partnership associate with Newcastle University and Merit.

  - **Process optimization:** Translating manufacturing operational needs into digital transformation requirements.
  - **Product owner:** Development and coordination of PowerApps (e.g., MES solutions) to improve the operational visibility of manufacturing shop floors.
  - **ETL pipelines:** Implementation of workflows to store manufacturing-driven data streams into databases.
  - **Data mining:** Development of feature-extracted datasets by fusing manufacturing and design data. These data streams are leveraged by machine and deep learning models to improve production monitoring, planning, and scheduling.
  - **Experimental campaign:** Coordination of large teams and 30+ stakeholders ranging from C-level executives to shop floor workers to deploy digital transformation manufacturing architectures.
  - **Dashboard:** Design and development of data analytics platforms to turn manufacturing data into actionable KPIs and improve manufacturing monitoring and planning.

- 2021-2025: PhD Candidate, University of Trento
  Chair: Manufacturing Systems

  - **Thesis**: Cyber-physical systems to monitor the efficiency and sustainability of human-centric manufacturing systems.
  - **IoT sensor**: Deployment of human-centric digital technologies to monitor manual task executions and safety of workers in industrial scenarios. Hands-on with many sensors such as RTLS (UWB), Inertial Measuring Units, Azure Kinect, RFID readers, and Electromyography. Responsible for designing the desired data flow and storage based on business requirements.
  - **ML frameworks/pipeline**: Applied ML algorithms to pre-processed and feature-extracted data, enabling target-oriented decision-making. Training, fine-tuning, and inference of PyTorch algorithms (supervised and unsupervised) in Jupyter Notebooks and HPC cluster.
  - **Experimental campaign**: Managing mid-term projects with plant supervisors to meet milestones and business goals. Responsible for architecture installation, data acquisition, and storage. Involvement of 70+ workers in production and logistics environments of both SMEs and multinational companies.
  - **Dashboards**: Delivering actionable KPIs and KRIs to drive strategic process monitoring and enable efficiency and safety-related business optimizations.
  - **Supervision**: Technical support and mentoring of students for Master's, Bachelor thesis, and freshman Ph.D. students.
  - **Dissemination**: Deliver engaging presentations to both technical and non-technical audiences at major conferences, enhancing the team's visibility and attracting potential new collaborations.

- 2023: Visiting PhD Candidate, University of Twente
  Chair: Manufacturing Systems

  - **Project**: Development of a cyber-physical architecture to monitor human-centric reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS)
  - **IoT sensor**: Design, installation, and test of an UWB-based RTLS to monitor industrial entities and the workforce in a RMS set-up
  - **ML frameworks/pipeline**: Applied ML algorithms to pre-processed and feature-extracted data, enabling target-oriented decision-making. Training, fine-tuning, and inference of PyTorch algorithms (supervised and unsupervised) in Jupyter Notebooks.
  - **Experimental campaign**: Managed more than 40+ students across 8 production set-up, resulting in a dataset of more that 1M input data.
  - **Dashboards**: Delivering actionable KPIs to monitor the efficiency and social sustainability of RMS environments.
  - **Supervision**: Technical support and mentoring of Learning Factory students.

- 2020-2021: Research Assistant, University of Göttingen
  Chair: Production and Logistics
  - **Support**: Lecture preparation and student mentoring and support throughout the course
  - **Laboratory**: Delivered 8 hours of lectures utilizing simulation tools to address real-world case applications
  - **Research Project**: Literature review on the usage of indoor positioning systems in manufacturing and logistics environments
